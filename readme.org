* My ~/.emacs.d
  This is my Emacs configuration.

  If you'd like to see how any package is configured or what bindings and chords are defined, search for the corresponding use-package block in the file init.el

  I do web for work, and mainly C and lisp for fun, so that is what my config is geared towards. A lot of Railsy and JS things are part of the config, like yaml, haml, sass, projectile-rails, rspec, js2-mode, and more.
